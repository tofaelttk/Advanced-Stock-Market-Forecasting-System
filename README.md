Advanced Stock Market Forecasting System

Overview

The stock_forecast.py script is an advanced financial forecasting framework that employs deep learning, machine learning, and statistical models to predict stock market movements. It integrates various time-series modeling techniques to enhance prediction accuracy and market trend analysis.

Features

Deep Learning (LSTM): Implements Bidirectional LSTM networks for capturing sequential dependencies in stock price movements.

XGBoost Integration: Employs gradient-boosted decision trees for robust feature-based stock prediction.

Facebook Prophet: Leverages Prophetâ€™s additive time-series decomposition for trend forecasting.

GARCH Model: Uses Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) for volatility estimation.

Bayesian Optimization: Optimizes hyperparameters using Bayesian search strategies.

Technical Indicators: Incorporates TA-Lib for feature engineering (moving averages, RSI, MACD, etc.).

Robust Data Scaling: Uses RobustScaler for handling outliers in financial time-series data.

Interactive Visualization: Generates real-time financial charts with Plotly.

Installation

Ensure that your environment has Python installed, then install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

To run stock forecasting using the script, execute:

python stock_forecast.py --data_path path/to/your/stock_data.csv

The system will process stock data, extract features, apply predictive models, and visualize results.

Model Architecture

The system employs multiple machine learning and statistical models in parallel:

LSTM Neural Networks: Captures sequential trends in time-series data.

Prophet Forecasting: Identifies seasonality and long-term trends.

XGBoost Regression: Incorporates engineered features for stock price prediction.

GARCH Volatility Modeling: Estimates financial market risk and fluctuations.

Future Enhancements

Transformer-based architectures (e.g., Time-Series Transformers)

Reinforcement Learning for market strategy optimization

Integration with live stock market APIs for real-time predictions
